# ComfyUI KIE API Nodes

## Project overview
This repository provides a set of ComfyUI custom nodes that connect to the Kie.ai API for image and video generation workflows.

## Why this exists

## What’s included
- Image generation nodes
- Image-to-video and text-to-video nodes
- Utility helpers for grid slicing and prompt parsing

Node-specific documentation is available in `web/docs`.
